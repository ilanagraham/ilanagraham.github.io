    <h1>
    About Aploro
    </h1>

      <p> I came up with the idea for this site when i was searching for a hairdresser capable of doing the hairstyle i wanted, in close proximity to where i lived. Having scoured through instagram for hours i found a long list of hairdressers (most that I’ve never even heard of) and thought about how difficult it was to find what i was searching for. This is when i came up with the idea of compiling this list and making it into a directory site which i named Aploro. The directory features small women-owned businesses ranging from hairdressers to clothing brands with the aim to make it quicker and easier for people to find what they’re looking for.
